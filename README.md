# Frontend Engineer Test

Hi, my name is Iv√°n. I really like your test and I have a lot of fun doing it. I didn't want to exceed by much the two hours you require to complete the test so there are some things that I couldn't fix (like the image flickering). 
Thanks for this opportunity and I hope we can meet soon.
